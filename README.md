# PHY294
Data processing scripts for PHY294 Labs.

Consists of calculations, curve fitting, graphing data, etc.

For future PHY294 students, don't plagiarize, if you choose to do so, we accept no responsibility for your actions. It's easy and useful to learn how to do this stuff anyway.
Good luck :)
